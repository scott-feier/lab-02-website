    <h3>A note by the author</h3>

    <p>This is my second Practical Series publicationâ€”this one happened by accident too. The first publication is all about building a website, you can see it here. This publication came about because I wanted some sort of version control mechanism for the first publication.</p>

    <p>There are lots of different version control systems (VCS) out there; some are free, some are commercial applications just google it. If you do, you will find that Git and GitHub show up again and again.</p>
